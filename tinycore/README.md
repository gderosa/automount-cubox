Use the TinyCore Backup tool to make file chenges persistent!

Also use the TinyCore "Apps" package tool to state which packages
you want available after reboot (persistance of software
installation).

Here we assume /dev/sda1 is the device used for persistence.

We don't want it to be shown to end users in mnttool GUI, so a
few edits to system scripts have been made.
